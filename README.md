# Sentiment-Analysis-Using-Bert

The text is an in-depth tutorial on sentiment analysis using the BERT model from Hugging Face, a popular NLP library. It encompasses several key steps:

1. **Introduction and Library Setup**: The guide begins with a brief introduction to sentiment analysis in natural language processing, emphasizing its importance in understanding human emotions in text. It specifically focuses on the use of BERT, a leading model developed by Google for NLP tasks. The setup includes installing and importing necessary libraries like TensorFlow, numpy, matplotlib, sklearn, and more, each serving a specific function in the process (e.g., TensorFlow for model building, numpy for mathematical computations, matplotlib for plotting graphs).

2. **Data Handling and Preprocessing**: This section dives into data preparation, particularly using the IMDb dataset for sentiment analysis. The guide outlines how to load the dataset using Hugging Face's `datasets` library and preprocess it for BERT. Preprocessing involves tokenizing text data - converting text into numerical tokens that can be processed by the model. The text also explains key concepts like input IDs, token type IDs, and attention masks, which are critical for understanding how BERT processes text data.

3. **Model Training and Optimization**: The core of the guide is about training the BERT model. It details loading a pre-trained BERT model using Hugging Face's `transformers` library and setting it up for sequence classification. The training process involves compiling the model with loss functions and optimizers, fitting the model on the training data, and evaluating it on validation data. The guide provides insights into model optimization techniques like learning rate scheduling and introduces concepts like early stopping to prevent overfitting.

4. **Evaluation and Analysis**: Post-training, the guide discusses evaluating the model's performance by plotting training and validation loss and accuracy. This part is crucial for understanding model behavior over epochs and identifying issues like overfitting. It also suggests ways to improve model performance, like implementing dropout layers or using regularization techniques.

5. **Practical Application**: The guide concludes with a practical application section where the trained model is used to analyze sentiments of specific text inputs. It demonstrates how to tokenize new text data and interpret the model's predictions.

Overall, the project is a comprehensive walkthrough for anyone looking to understand and implement sentiment analysis using BERT and Hugging Face, covering both the theoretical aspects and practical implementation steps.
